//----------------------[ CYPHER-X ]----------------------//

//File System module - because even bots need to read and write💁‍♂️
const { color } = require('./lib/color')
//Colouring console because plain text is quite boring😑
if (fs.existsSync('.env')) require('dotenv').config({ path: __dirname+'/.env' })

//--------------------[ SESSION ID ]----------------------//

global.SESSION_ID = process.env.SESSION_ID || '' 
// You know the drill. Put your CypherX session id here. Should look like: XPLOADER-BOT:~ (don't forget that, it's crucial!)

//--------------------[ BOT NAME ]----------------------//

global.botname = process.env.BOT_NAME || 'CypherX' 
// Pick a name for the bot. Default is "CypherX" — but who doesn’t love a cool bot name?

//-----------------[ OWNER NUMBER ]------------------//

global.ownernumber = process.env.OWNER_NUMBER || '254754783972' 
// Your personal contact number. If you want to call Tylor, this is the number. 👀

//-----------------[ OWNER NAME ]------------------//

global.ownername = process.env.OWNER_NAME || 'Tylor' 
// Set your name, currently it's the mastermind's. The one and only... Tylor. (Don't ask how I got here, it's a mystery.)

//------------[ STICKER PACKNAME ]-----------------//

global.packname = process.env.STICKER_PACK_NAME || "Cypher" 
// Time to decide the name for your sticker pack. This will appear every time you create a sticker. "Cypher" is the default because... well, why not?

//--------------[ STICKER AUTHOR NAME ]------------//

global.author = process.env.STICKER_AUTHOR_NAME || "X" 
// Who's the artist behind those epic stickers? You, of course! Unless you're just using the default name "X" – mystery vibes!

//----------------------[ TIMEZONE ]--------------------//

global.timezones = process.env.TIMEZONE || "Africa/Nairobi" 
// The bot is time-traveling. Set the timezone correctly. Trust us, you don't want the bot to get confused. 🕒

//--------------[ POSTGRES DATABASE ]----------------//

global.postgresqls = process.env.DATABASE_URL || "";
// Your database URL. If you're using panel, no need to fill, if you're using Heroku, this will be automatically filled. Let the magic happen!

//-----------------[ CONTEXT LINK ]--------------------//

global.plink = process.env.PLINK || "https://www.instagram.com/heyits_tylor?igsh=YzljYTk1ODg3Zg---"
// Where does the journey end? Maybe an Instagram link? Or WhatsApp link🤔 Or maybe just a placeholder. Who knows? 👀

//------------------[ WATERMARK ]--------------------//

global.wm = process.env.GL_WM || "©CypherX is on fire!🔥"
// Add a watermark finished tasks because... every masterpiece needs a signature.

//---------------------[ REPLIES ]-----------------------//

/* Do not change anything here!!! Or I’ll send CypherX after you... 😈 */

// botz = m (Not to be confused with 'The bot'... he's cooler.)
// isOwner = 🤔 (But only on special days... we keep it mysterious)
// isCypherAdmin = 🗿 (Admin powers are granted by CypherX, no exceptions!)


//--------------------[ WATCHER ]-----------------------//
// Who’s watching the watchers? 🤔
// Let’s keep track of any changes like a hawk in a top hat.

//----------------------[ CYPHER-X ]----------------------//
// CypherX is like a cat. It might ignore you, but it knows what you’re up to. 🐱
// It only responds when it feels like it. It’s the true master of mystery.
// Please proceed with caution. Our code doesn’t bite, but it might give you an awkward look.
// Tylor? If you’ve found this, you’ve unlocked a secret... but only if you truly understand it.
